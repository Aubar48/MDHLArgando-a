        a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in
        the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
        minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
        assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
        whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
        from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
        field may be required to play all their games away.</p>
